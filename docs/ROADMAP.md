# ScoreMyClays Product Roadmap

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the evolution of ScoreMyClays from a focused MVP to a comprehensive clay shooting platform. Development follows a **user-driven, iterative approach** starting with core MVP functionality and progressively adding features based on real user feedback and market validation.

## Development Philosophy

- **MVP First**: Validate core concept with minimal, essential features
- **User-Driven**: Add features based on user feedback and usage patterns
- **Incremental Growth**: Build complexity gradually to maintain stability

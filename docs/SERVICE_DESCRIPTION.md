ScoreMyClays is a mobile-first web application designed specifically for clay pigeon shooting scoring and performance tracking in the UK market. The service provides offline-capable scoring for ESP, DTL, and Skeet disciplines, with professional analytics and social features tailored to the needs of the 60,000 regular UK clay shooters who generate 96% of shooting activity. Built with a freemium model targeting individual shooters and a B2B tier for shooting clubs, the app addresses the critical need for reliable digital scoring at shooting grounds with poor connectivity while offering the professional presentation and detailed performance insights that committed clay shooters demand.

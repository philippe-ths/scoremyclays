| **TOTAL** | **143,215** | | | | **2,964,250** | **100%** |

## Key Market Insights

### Round Volume Analysis
- **Total UK market**: ~3 million rounds of 100 clays annually
- **Monthly + Club Regulars drive 96%** of all shooting volume
- Professional shooters shoot 1.5 rounds per session (150 clays) for intensive practice
- Casual market shoots fractional rounds (25-50 clays per session)

### Market Concentration
- **Top 2 segments** (Monthly + Club Regulars) = 60,000 shooters (42% of people) generate **96% of round volume**
- **Bottom 2 segments** (Sporadic + "Have a Go") = 83,000 shooters (58% of people) generate **2% of round volume**

## Professional Level Breakdown

| Level | Numbers | Sessions/Year | Competition + Practice |
|-------|---------|---------------|------------------------|
| International | 15 | 250 | Intensive daily practice + global competitions |
| National | 50 | 200 | Regular practice + national circuit |
| Regional | 150 | 180 | Moderate practice + regional events |

### Professional Practice Rationale:
- **International**: Near-daily practice (6 days/week) plus competition travel
- **National**: 4-5 sessions/week including competition preparation
- **Regional**: 3-4 sessions/week with weekend competitions

## Clay Round Economics

### Annual Round Consumption by Segment

| Category | Round Volume | % of Total Volume | Revenue Driver |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|----------------|
| Club Regulars | 1,440,000 | 48.6% | Premium pricing tolerance |
| Monthly Regulars | 1,404,000 | 47.4% | Highest value segment |
| Professional | 64,500 | 2.2% | Sponsor/prize support |
| Sporadic | 43,750 | 1.5% | Price sensitive |
| "Have a Go" | 12,000 | 0.4% | Experience pricing |

## Business Implications

1. **Nearly 3 million rounds** of 100 clays shot annually in UK
2. **Club + Monthly Regulars are the revenue backbone** - 2.84M rounds between them
3. **Casual market has minimal shooting volume** but potential for conversion upward

## Data Quality Assessment

### Reliable Numbers ✓
- **CPSA membership**: 22,500 (definitive)
- **Sport England participants**: 80,000 (reliable methodology)
- **Professional competitors**: ~215 (can be counted from competition entries)

### Estimated Numbers ⚠️
- **Club Regulars (weekly)**: 8,000 (inferred from CPSA data and ground capacity)
- **Monthly participants**: 52,000 (triangulated from Sport England and CPSA gap)
- **Sporadic shooters**: 35,000 (educated guess based on club membership patterns)

### Highly Uncertain ❌
- **"Have a Go" market**: 48,000 (corporate/tourism - no reliable data)
- **Total market size**: 130,000-180,000 (wide range reflects uncertainty)

## Critical Gaps in Data

### What We Don't Know
1. **Casual market size** - Corporate events, stag parties, tourism
2. **Participation frequency** - How often do CPSA members actually shoot?
3. **Geographic distribution** - Regional variations unknown
4. **Retention rates** - How many "have a go" shooters return?
5. **Overlap** - Do Sport England's 80,000 include all CPSA members?

## The 57,500 Gap

The difference between CPSA membership (22,500) and Sport England participants (80,000) represents **regular clay shooters who participate monthly but aren't CPSA members**. This is likely the **largest addressable market for growth**.

## Round Volume Distribution

### High-Volume Segments:
- **Club Regulars**: 180 sessions/year, 1 round per session = 180 rounds/person/year
- **Monthly Regulars**: 36 sessions/year, 0.75 rounds per session = 27 rounds/person/year  
- **Professional**: 200 sessions/year, 1.5 rounds per session = 300 rounds/person/year

### Low-Volume Segments:
- **Sporadic**: 2.5 sessions/year, 0.5 rounds per session = 1.25 rounds/person/year
- **"Have a Go"**: 1 session/year, 0.25 rounds per session = 0.25 rounds/person/year

## Practice vs Competition Volume

### Professional Shooters:
- **Competition rounds**: ~60/year (40 competitions x 1.5 rounds average)
- **Practice rounds**: ~240/year (160 practice sessions x 1.5 rounds)
- **Total per professional**: 300 rounds/year (highest individual consumption)

## Market Value Insights

- **Total annual rounds**: ~3 million (100-clay equivalents)
- **Revenue concentration** in Monthly + Club Regular segments
- **Professional segment** high per-person volume but small total impact
- **Conversion from casual to regular participation** offers highest growth potential

## Data Reliability Warning

⚠️ **Important Limitations:**
- **Methodology Choice**: Deliberately excluded "Value of Shooting" reports as these are industry-funded promotional materials produced by trade associations for government lobbying purposes, not independent market research
- Round estimates based solely on: CPSA membership (22,500), Sport England participants (80,000), and observable ground operations
- Shooting frequency assumptions based on competition schedules and typical club patterns
- **Major data gap**: No comprehensive survey of actual shooting frequency across all segments

**Data Quality Approach:** This analysis intentionally relies on independently verifiable sources (government participation surveys, official association membership) rather than industry advocacy materials that typically inflate figures to support lobbying efforts.

*Analysis based on available public data, May 2025. Round volume estimates derived from CPSA membership and Sport England participation data only - industry promotional reports deliberately excluded due to methodological concerns and advocacy bias. Significant uncertainty remains in shooting frequency assumptions across all segments.*

# ScoreMyClays

A mobile application for clay pigeon shooting scoring and performance tracking, designed specifically for the UK clay shooting community.

## Overview

ScoreMyClays is an independent project focused on digitizing clay shooting scoring with robust offline capabilities, professional analytics, and social features. Built for the unique needs of clay shooting disciplines including ESP (English Sporting), DTL (Down The Line), Skeet, Trap, and Sporting Clays.

### Key Features

- **Offline-First Scoring**: Works reliably at shooting grounds with poor connectivity
- **Multiple Disciplines**: ESP, DTL, Skeet, Trap, and Sporting Clays support
- **Professional Analytics**: Performance tracking and classification management
- **Social Features**: Share scorecards and compare with shooting partners
- **Club Integration**: B2B features for shooting clubs and competitions

## Market Opportunity

- **130-180k** total clay shooting participants in the UK
- **60k regular shooters** (Monthly + Club Regulars) generate 96% of activity volume
- **3 million rounds** shot annually (100-clay equivalents)
- Target market: 60k regulars who drive revenue concentration
- Proven digital transformation success in golf (78% core golfer adoption)

## Technology Approach

- **Mobile-first** responsive design (375px-768px)
- **Offline-capable** architecture for unreliable connectivity
- **High contrast UI** optimized for outdoor conditions
- **Large touch targets** designed for gloved hands
- **Professional presentation** adapted from successful golf apps

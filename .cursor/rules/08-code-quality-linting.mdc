# Code Quality and Linting Standards

## ESLint Configuration

Configure ESLint with comprehensive TypeScript and React rules for clay shooting app development.

### Core Setup
- Use `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin@^8.0.0` for TypeScript support
- Include `eslint-plugin-unused-imports` for clean imports
- Enable `next/core-web-vitals` for Next.js best practices
- Add `prettier` to extends array LAST to prevent conflicts

### Required Dependencies
Install these packages for optimal linting:
```bash
npm install --save-dev @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin @typescript-eslint/parser eslint-plugin-unused-imports
```

### Configuration Structure
Ensure `.eslintrc.cjs` includes these key settings:
- TypeScript parser with project configuration
- React and accessibility rules for mobile clay shooting context
- Performance rules for PWA optimization
- Import organization and unused code detection

## Code Quality Rules

Follow these standards for clay shooting app development:

### TypeScript Standards
- Use proper type annotations, avoid `any` types
- Prefer `import type` for type-only imports
- Handle promises with proper await/catch patterns
- Use consistent type imports with inline style

### React Standards
- Include proper keys for JSX elements
- Avoid array index as keys for dynamic lists
- Follow React Hooks rules and dependencies
- Use accessibility attributes for outdoor mobile use

### Performance Standards
- Remove unused variables and imports
- Use efficient component patterns
- Follow mobile-first optimization principles
- Handle async operations properly

### Clay Shooting Context
- Prioritize touch-friendly interfaces
- Ensure outdoor visibility considerations
- Optimize for offline-first scenarios
- Handle scoring data with type safety

## Development Workflow

### Daily Development
1. Write code with real-time ESLint feedback
2. Address red squiggles immediately for logic issues
3. Use auto-fix for correctable issues
4. Focus on code quality, not formatting

### Pre-Commit Checklist
Run these commands before committing:
```bash
npm run lint          # Check code quality
npm run lint:fix      # Fix auto-fixable issues
npm run type-check    # Verify TypeScript
```

### Error Resolution
- **Logic errors**: Fix immediately, they indicate real problems
- **TypeScript errors**: Address type safety issues properly
- **Accessibility warnings**: Important for outdoor mobile use
- **Performance warnings**: Critical for clay shooting app responsiveness

## VS Code Integration

Configure VS Code for optimal development experience:
- Enable ESLint extension for real-time feedback
- Set up auto-fix on save for correctable issues
- Configure proper file associations for TypeScript/React
- Use ESLint for code quality validation only

Maintain separation of concerns: ESLint for logic and quality, separate tools for formatting.

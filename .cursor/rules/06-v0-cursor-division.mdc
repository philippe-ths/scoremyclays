# v0 and Cursor Division of Responsibilities

## CRITICAL: Tool-Specific Responsibilities

### v0.dev Responsibilities (UI/UX ONLY)
1. **Visual Design**: All component styling, layouts, and visual elements
2. **User Experience**: User flows, interactions, and interface behavior
3. **Component Structure**: JSX structure and component composition
4. **CSS/Styling**: All Tailwind classes, custom CSS, and visual styling
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first layouts and breakpoint handling
6. **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes, semantic HTML, and accessibility patterns
7. **UI Component Creation**: New UI components and their visual implementation

### Cursor Responsibilities (Everything Except UI/UX)
1. **Business Logic**: All application logic, state management, and data processing
2. **API Integration**: Backend connections, data fetching, and external services
3. **Database Operations**: Data models, queries, and persistence
4. **Authentication**: User auth, security, and permission systems
5. **Performance Optimization**: Code optimization, caching, and performance tuning
6. **Testing**: Unit tests, integration tests, and quality assurance
7. **Infrastructure**: Build systems, CI/CD, deployment, and configuration
8. **Type Safety**: TypeScript types, interfaces, and type definitions
9. **Utilities**: Helper functions, libraries, and non-UI utilities

## IMPERATIVE: Cursor UI/UX Restrictions

### What Cursor MUST NOT Do
1. **Never modify visual styling** - No changes to Tailwind classes or CSS
2. **Never alter component structure** - No changes to JSX layout or hierarchy
3. **Never change UI interactions** - No modifications to user interface behavior
4. **Never add visual elements** - No new buttons, forms, or UI components
5. **Never modify responsive behavior** - No changes to mobile/desktop layouts
6. **Never alter accessibility attributes** - No changes to ARIA or semantic HTML

### What Cursor MUST Do Instead
1. **Conform to existing UI** - Work within the established v0 design system
2. **Preserve visual integrity** - Maintain all existing styling and layouts
3. **Implement logic only** - Add functionality without changing appearance
4. **Request v0 changes** - When UI changes are needed, explicitly request v0 work
5. **Document UI needs** - Clearly specify what UI changes would be helpful
6. **Work around UI constraints** - Implement features within existing interface

## Clay Shooting App Specific Guidelines

### v0 Handles
- Scoring interface design and clay shooting-specific UI elements
- Outdoor visibility optimizations and touch-friendly interfaces
- Clay shooting workflow user experience and navigation
- Mobile-first responsive design for outdoor shooting environments
- Visual feedback for scoring actions and clay shooting terminology

### Cursor Handles
- Offline scoring data persistence and synchronization
- Clay shooting calculation logic and scoring algorithms
- Performance optimization for real-time clay shooting scenarios
- Integration with clay shooting data sources and external services
- Security and user authentication for clay shooting communities

## Workflow Integration

### When UI Changes Are Needed
1. **Document the requirement** - Clearly specify what UI change is needed
2. **Request v0 work** - Explicitly state that v0 should handle the UI update
3. **Implement supporting logic** - Add necessary backend logic for new UI features
4. **Maintain separation** - Never implement UI changes directly in Cursor

### v0 Handoff Requirements
1. **Preserve component props** - Maintain all existing prop interfaces
2. **Keep event handlers** - Preserve onClick, onChange, and other event patterns
3. **Maintain data flow** - Keep existing state and data passing patterns
4. **Document changes** - Clearly communicate any new logic requirements

### Quality Assurance
1. **Visual integrity checks** - Verify no unintended UI changes occurred
2. **Functionality validation** - Ensure logic works with existing UI
3. **Mobile testing** - Confirm clay shooting app works on mobile devices
4. **Accessibility verification** - Validate outdoor usability is maintained

## Error Prevention

### Before Making Changes
1. **Identify if change affects UI** - If yes, request v0 work instead
2. **Verify logic-only scope** - Ensure changes are purely functional
3. **Check existing UI patterns** - Work within established interface
4. **Validate no styling impact** - Confirm no visual changes will occur

### During Implementation
1. **Preserve all UI code** - Never modify JSX structure or styling
2. **Use existing event patterns** - Work with established UI interactions
3. **Maintain responsive behavior** - Don't break mobile clay shooting interface
4. **Keep accessibility intact** - Preserve outdoor usability features

*Maintain strict separation: v0 creates and owns all visual design, Cursor implements all logic and infrastructure while conforming to v0's UI/UX decisions.*

# Development Workflow Standards

## Integrated Development Environment

Establish a seamless development workflow combining ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript for optimal clay shooting app development.

### Tool Separation and Integration
- **ESLint**: Code quality, logic validation, best practices
- **Prettier**: Code formatting, style consistency, automatic fixes
- **TypeScript**: Type safety, compile-time error detection
- **VS Code**: Unified interface with real-time feedback

### Conflict-Free Configuration
Ensure tools work together without interference:
- ESLint extends `prettier` config last to disable formatting rules
- Prettier handles all formatting automatically
- TypeScript provides type checking separate from linting
- VS Code integrates all tools with proper precedence

## Daily Development Workflow

### Immediate Feedback Loop
1. **Write code** with TypeScript intellisense and error detection
2. **See ESLint feedback** as red squiggles for logic issues only
3. **Save files** to trigger automatic Prettier formatting
4. **Auto-fix** correctable ESLint issues on save
5. **Focus on logic** while tools handle style and basic fixes

### Real-Time Quality Assurance
- Address TypeScript errors immediately for type safety
- Fix ESLint errors as they appear for code quality
- Trust Prettier for consistent formatting across the project
- Use import organization features for clean code structure

## Pre-Commit Workflow

### Quality Checklist
Run these commands before every commit:
```bash
# 1. Check code quality and logic
npm run lint

# 2. Verify formatting consistency  
npm run format:check

# 3. Ensure type safety
npm run type-check

# 4. Fix auto-correctable issues
npm run lint:fix

# 5. Format any unformatted files
npm run format
```

### Error Resolution Priority
1. **TypeScript errors**: Fix immediately, they prevent builds
2. **ESLint errors**: Address logic and safety issues
3. **ESLint warnings**: Review and fix for better code quality
4. **Formatting issues**: Let Prettier handle automatically

## Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript Best Practices
- Use explicit types instead of `any` for scoring data
- Implement proper error handling for offline clay shooting scenarios
- Use type guards for user input validation
- Prefer `import type` for type-only imports

### React Best Practices
- Implement proper keys for dynamic clay shooting round lists
- Use accessibility attributes for outdoor mobile usage
- Handle async operations with proper loading states
- Optimize re-renders for touch-responsive scoring interfaces

### Mobile PWA Considerations
- Write performant code for clay shooting contexts
- Handle offline scenarios gracefully
- Optimize for touch interfaces and outdoor visibility
- Implement proper error boundaries for scoring sessions

## VS Code Optimization

### Extension Requirements
Install these extensions for optimal workflow:
- ESLint extension for real-time code quality feedback
- Prettier extension for automatic formatting
- TypeScript support (built-in) for type checking
- Error Lens for enhanced error visibility

### Settings Configuration
Configure `.vscode/settings.json` for unified experience:
- Prettier as default formatter for automatic styling
- ESLint auto-fix on save for correctable issues
- Format on save for consistent code appearance
- Proper file associations for TypeScript and React

## Performance Optimization

### Development Speed
- Use ESLint for logic only, avoiding slow formatting rules
- Enable incremental TypeScript compilation for faster builds
- Configure file watching for immediate feedback
- Use separate tools for separate concerns

### Build Performance
- Run type checking separate from linting for faster builds
- Use efficient ESLint rules for mobile PWA requirements
- Optimize formatting runs for large codebases
- Cache tool outputs when possible

## Team Collaboration

### Consistency Standards
- Enforce formatting with Prettier for zero style debates
- Use ESLint rules for shared code quality standards
- Maintain TypeScript strict mode for type safety
- Document any rule exceptions with clear reasoning

### Code Review Focus
- Review logic and architecture, not formatting
- Focus on clay shooting domain accuracy
- Verify accessibility for outdoor mobile usage
- Ensure offline-first patterns are followed

Maintain separation of concerns: tools handle style, developers focus on clay shooting app logic and user experience.

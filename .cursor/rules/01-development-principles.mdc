# Development Principles

## Core Project Principles

1. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Eliminate code duplication by creating reusable functions, components, and configurations
   - Define logic once and reuse across the codebase
   - Create shared utilities for common operations
   - Use consistent patterns and abstractions
   - Example: `npm run dev:stop` logic used by `npm run dev`

2. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: Favor simple, clear solutions over complex ones
   - Choose the most straightforward approach that works
   - Avoid over-engineering and premature optimization
   - Write code that others can easily understand and maintain
   - Example: Simple localStorage over complex state management for MVP

## Code Quality

1. **Clean Code**: Write readable, maintainable code with clear naming
2. **Mobile-First**: Design for mobile devices and touch interfaces
3. **Performance**: Optimize for fast loading and smooth interactions
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure usability for all clay shooters
5. **Security**: Protect user data and scoring information

## Clay Shooting Context

1. **Understand the Sport**: Reference research documents for clay shooting terminology and workflow
2. **Shooter-Centric Design**: Prioritize ease of use during shooting activities
3. **Offline Capability**: Ensure core scoring works without internet connection
4. **Quick Actions**: Minimize taps and input for common scoring tasks
5. **Clear Feedback**: Provide immediate visual confirmation of scoring inputs

## Development Workflow

1. **Specification First**: Reference `/docs/FUNCTIONAL_SPEC.md` before implementing features
2. **Research Informed**: Use `/research/` insights to guide design decisions
3. **Prototype Early**: Create mockups in `/src/mock_up/` before full implementation
4. **Test Frequently**: Validate with clay shooting use cases
5. **Document Changes**: Update relevant documentation with implementation details

## Quality Standards

1. **User Testing**: Test with actual clay shooting scenarios
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Ensure fast response times
3. **Error Handling**: Gracefully handle input errors and edge cases
4. **Cross-Platform**: Test on multiple devices and screen sizes
5. **Consistent UI**: Follow design system guidelines

*Apply these principles throughout all development work*

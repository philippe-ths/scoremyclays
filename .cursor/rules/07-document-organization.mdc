# Document Organization Standards

## Documentation Categories

### Persistent Documents (`/docs/`)
- **Purpose**: Long-term project documentation integrated into Docusaurus site
- **Location**: `/docs/` directory
- **Integration**: Must be accessible through Docusaurus navigation
- **Lifecycle**: Maintained throughout project development and beyond

**Examples**:
- Functional specifications
- API documentation  
- User guides
- Design system documentation
- Architecture decisions
- Installation guides

### Ephemeral Documents (`/plans/`)
- **Purpose**: Temporary planning, task lists, and working documents
- **Location**: `/plans/` directory
- **Integration**: Not integrated into Docusaurus
- **Lifecycle**: Created for specific tasks, archived or deleted when complete

**Examples**:
- Implementation plans
- Task lists and todos
- Meeting notes
- Brainstorming documents
- Temporary analysis
- Setup instructions for development

## Implementation Guidelines

### Creating Persistent Documentation
1. **Create in `/docs/`**: All long-term documentation must be in the docs directory
2. **Docusaurus Integration**: Ensure new documents are added to Docusaurus navigation
3. **User-Focused**: Write from the perspective of clay shooters and app users
4. **Maintenance**: Keep documentation current with implementation changes

### Creating Ephemeral Documentation  
1. **Create in `/plans/`**: All temporary working documents go in plans directory
2. **Clear Purpose**: Include creation date and specific purpose
3. **Cleanup**: Remove or archive when task is complete
4. **No Docusaurus**: These documents should not be integrated into the documentation site

### Document Transitions
- **Plans to Docs**: When ephemeral planning becomes permanent knowledge, migrate content to `/docs/`
- **Cleanup Process**: Regularly review `/plans/` and remove obsolete documents
- **Archive Strategy**: Important completed plans can be moved to `/plans/archive/`

## Quality Standards

### Persistent Documents
- **Complete**: Provide comprehensive coverage of the topic
- **Current**: Keep synchronized with actual implementation
- **Accessible**: Written for target audience (clay shooters, developers)
- **Navigable**: Properly linked in Docusaurus site structure

### Ephemeral Documents
- **Focused**: Single purpose, specific timeframe
- **Actionable**: Clear next steps and outcomes
- **Temporary**: Not intended for long-term reference
- **Self-Contained**: Include necessary context for completion

*Maintain clear separation between persistent and ephemeral documentation to ensure proper organization and site structure*

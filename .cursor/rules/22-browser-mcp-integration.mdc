# Browser MCP Universal Integration Standards

## Core Browser MCP Principles

Use Browser MCP as a **universal debugging and inspection layer** across all testing tiers, providing real-time UI access and eliminating screenshot workflows for ScoreMyClays MVP development.

### When to Use Browser MCP

**Universal Application**:

- Unit test AI generation and real browser validation
- Component test real browser interaction verification
- E2E test live debugging and real-time inspection
- Cross-cutting error detection and performance monitoring
- Eliminates all screenshot copy/paste workflows

**MVP-Specific**:

- Sporting Clays workflow testing (10 positions × 10 targets)
- Real browser PWA testing with actual touch interactions
- Session persistence testing for MVP session structure
- Offline functionality validation with real service workers
- Touch interface testing on actual mobile browsers

### Browser MCP Configuration Requirements

Configure Browser MCP servers in all supported AI environments:

#### Cursor Configuration

Add to Cursor MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@browsermcp/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Claude Desktop Configuration

Add to claude_desktop_config.json:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "browser-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@browsermcp/mcp@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Chrome Extension Setup

Always install and configure the Browser MCP Chrome Extension:

1. Install from Chrome Web Store
2. Pin extension to Chrome toolbar
3. Click extension icon and connect to MCP server
4. Test connection with simple navigation commands

### Browser MCP Testing Patterns

#### MVP Sporting Clays Workflow Testing

Use natural language commands for MVP scenarios:

- "Navigate to ScoreMyClays and start a new Sporting Clays session"
- "Enter ground name 'Test Range' and shooter name 'Test Shooter'"
- "Complete position 1 with scoring pattern: 8 hits, 2 misses"
- "Test offline functionality during scoring session"
- "Verify data persistence after browser restart"

#### PWA-Specific Testing

Test PWA features with real browser behavior:

- Install PWA and test installed app behavior
- Test service worker functionality with actual cache
- Validate offline/online transitions with real network states
- Test touch gestures and mobile responsiveness

### Integration with Existing Testing Stack

Browser MCP complements but does not replace existing testing:

- **Unit Tests (Vitest)**: Business logic validation
- **Component Tests (React Testing Library)**: Component behavior
- **E2E Tests (Playwright)**: Structured automated workflows
- **Browser MCP**: AI-driven exploration and real browser validation

### Cost and Performance Optimization

Browser MCP provides cost advantages over cloud-based solutions:

- Zero cloud service costs (runs locally)
- Real browser session preservation
- Immediate feedback without network latency
- Privacy-preserving local automation

### MVP Domain Integration

Leverage Browser MCP for MVP-specific testing:

- Test Sporting Clays workflow only (10 positions × 10 targets)
- Validate outdoor visibility and touch responsiveness
- Test individual session management (no squad features)
- Verify scoring accuracy under rapid input scenarios

### Quality Assurance

Ensure Browser MCP testing maintains high standards:

- Document AI-generated test scenarios
- Validate Browser MCP results with structured tests
- Monitor performance impact of real browser automation
- Maintain Browser MCP extension and server updates

Use Browser MCP as the primary tool for AI-enhanced testing requiring real browser interactions and MVP Sporting Clays workflow validation.

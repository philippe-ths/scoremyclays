# Project Structure Guidelines

## Directory Organization

### Core Directories

- **`/docs/`** - Project specifications and design guides
  - `FUNCTIONAL_SPEC.md` - Complete functional specification (reference first)
  - `FEATURES.md` - Comprehensive feature specifications  
  - `DESIGN_GUIDES/` - UI/UX design system and guidelines
  - `FEASIBILITY_ANALYSIS.md` - Business case and market validation

- **`/research/`** - Market research and competitive analysis
  - `MARKET_RESEARCH.md` - UK clay shooting market analysis
  - `SHOOTER_NUMBERS.md` - Target audience and classification data
  - `GOLF_APPS/` - Competitive analysis from golf app market

- **`/app/`** - Main application development
  - Primary application code and build configuration
  - Progressive Web App (PWA) implementation

- **`/website/`** - Docusaurus documentation site
  - `package.json` - Documentation dependencies
  - `src/` - Docusaurus components and pages
  - `static/` - Static assets for documentation

- **`/src/mock_up/`** - UI prototypes and design exploration
  - HTML/CSS mockups for rapid prototyping
  - Design system component showcases

## File Organization Standards

### Naming Conventions
1. **Descriptive Names**: Use clear, descriptive file and directory names
2. **Consistency**: Follow established naming patterns within each directory
3. **Clay Shooting Context**: Use terminology familiar to clay shooters
4. **Version Control**: Use meaningful commit messages referencing features

### Project Files
1. **Documentation**: Keep `.md` files organized by purpose and audience
2. **Assets**: Store images and media in logical subdirectories
3. **Code**: Organize by feature and component responsibility
4. **Configuration**: Keep build and deployment configs in root or dedicated directories

## Development Workflow

1. **Start with Specs**: Reference `/docs/FUNCTIONAL_SPEC.md` before implementing
2. **Research First**: Check `/research/` for market insights and competitive analysis
3. **Prototype Early**: Use `/src/mock_up/` for design exploration
4. **Document Changes**: Update relevant documentation with implementation
5. **Maintain Structure**: Keep file organization clean and logical

## File Management

1. **Regular Cleanup**: Remove unused files and outdated prototypes
2. **Asset Optimization**: Compress images and optimize file sizes
3. **Version Control**: Track important files and ignore build artifacts
4. **Cross-References**: Maintain links between related documents
5. **Backup Strategy**: Ensure important work is properly version controlled

*Maintain clear project organization throughout development*

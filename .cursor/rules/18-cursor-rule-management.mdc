# Cursor Rule Management and Creation Methodology

This rule provides comprehensive guidelines for creating, editing, structuring, and maintaining Cursor Rules in .mdc format.

## CRITICAL: .mdc File Editing Requirements

**IMPERATIVE**: When creating, reading, or updating ANY Cursor rule (.mdc) files:

### For AI Agents
AI agents MUST use direct filesystem commands (cat, echo, printf, sed, etc.) via shell rather than Cursor's file editing tools.

### Required Method for AI Agents

1. **Use Shell Commands ONLY**:
   - `cat` for reading file contents
   - `cat >`, `printf`, `echo`, `sed` for file creation/modification
   - `cp` for backups before editing
   - `mv` for file replacements
   - `head`, `tail` for viewing file sections
   - `rm` to remove backup or obsolete rule files after successful update

2. **Reading Files**: Always use `cat` or `head` to read .mdc files
3. **Verify Content**: Always use `cat` or `head` after editing
4. **Force Writes**: Use `sync` to force filesystem writes
5. **Never Use**: Cursor's built-in file editing tools or read_file tool for .mdc files
6. **IMPERATIVE**: Always delete backup files (e.g., .backup) after a successful rule update to maintain a clean rules directory.

### Why This Matters
- Ensures proper formatting
- Avoids caching issues
- Guarantees rules are immediately written to disk
- Prevents corruption of rule metadata
- Maintains consistency in file operations

## Rule Format Requirements

### .mdc File Structure
1. **YAML Frontmatter**: Always enclosed in `---` delimiters
2. **Content Section**: Imperative directives below frontmatter
3. **External References**: Use `@path/to/file.ext` syntax for examples

### Required Frontmatter Fields
- `description` (string): Concise explanation for Agent Requested rules
- `globs` (array): File patterns for Auto Attached rules
- `alwaysApply` (boolean): Set true for Always rules, false otherwise

## Rule Types and Metadata Configuration

### Always Rules
- **Purpose**: Included in all AI contexts within scope
- **Metadata**: `alwaysApply: true`
- **Use Case**: Core principles, fundamental guidelines

### Auto Attached Rules
- **Purpose**: Triggered by specific file patterns
- **Metadata**: `globs: ["*.ts", "**/*.test.js"]`, `alwaysApply: true`
- **Use Case**: Technology-specific or file-type-specific guidance

### Agent Requested Rules
- **Purpose**: AI decides when to fetch based on description
- **Metadata**: `description: "..."`, `alwaysApply: true`
- **Use Case**: Specialized functionality or optional guidance

### Manual Rules
- **Purpose**: Explicitly invoked with @ruleName
- **Metadata**: `alwaysApply: true` (no globs or description)
- **Use Case**: Rare procedures or specific situations

## Content Organization Standards

### Directive-Focused Writing
1. **Use Imperative Commands**: "Configure X", "Ensure Y", "Validate Z"
2. **Avoid Passive Voice**: "The system should..." → "Configure the system to..."
3. **Be Specific**: Provide concrete, actionable steps
4. **Include Validation**: Specify how to verify completion

### Rule Simplification Guidelines
1. **Drastically Simplify**: Keep rules focused and concise
2. **Project-Specific**: Align all rules with actual project context
3. **Actionable Directives**: Every statement should guide action
4. **Remove Redundancy**: Eliminate overlapping or verbose content
5. **Essential Only**: Keep only rules that provide clear value

## Rule Naming and Organization

### Naming Convention
- **Format**: `NN-descriptive-topic-name.mdc`
- **Numbering**: Zero-padded sequential (00, 01, 02...)
- **Priority**: Lower numbers for foundational rules
- **Grouping**: Use letter suffix for related topics (05a, 05b)

### Content Hierarchy
1. **00-09**: Master guide, general principles, core concepts
2. **10-19**: Development workflow and methodology
3. **20-29**: Technology-specific guidelines
4. **30+**: Specialized topics and advanced features

## Rule Maintenance Requirements

### Quality Standards
- **Actionable Directives**: Every statement should guide action
- **Complete Context**: Provide sufficient detail to avoid ambiguity
- **Current Information**: Keep technology references up to date
- **Consistency**: Ensure consistency across all rules
- **Target under 200 lines per rule**: Keep rules focused and digestible

## Rule Creation Workflow

### 1. Planning Phase
- Identify need based on development patterns and requirements
- Determine appropriate rule type and metadata
- Choose numbering and naming following convention

### 2. Content Development
- Write focused, imperative directives
- Validate against quality standards
- Keep content concise and actionable

### 3. Integration Phase
- Use shell commands for .mdc file creation (per this rule)
- Remove backup files after update
- Test rule loading and auto-attachment

### 4. Validation Phase
- Verify YAML frontmatter syntax
- Confirm rule triggers correctly
- Test with AI agent to ensure effectiveness

*Invoke this rule when creating, updating, or maintaining Cursor Rules to ensure consistency and effectiveness.*
